Based on my research done thus far I want to focus more on the financial or  information and technology industry.  I really want to dig deeper into machine learning and deep learning. My ideal job would be to be able to work at a company that cares about its employees and I can learn new things that will help me grow my professional career as a data scientist. I want to be part of a small team but make a big impact. I also would want a job that  will allow me to further my understanding on topics such as machine learning and deep learning and overall allow me to grow.
